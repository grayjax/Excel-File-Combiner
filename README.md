# Excel-File-Combiner
Combine Multiple Excel Files

Files you are combining must have the same formatting (column names)

Put all files you want to combine in a folder and use that folder as the path in "folder_path" - replacing #PATH_TO_YOUR_FOLDER_WITH_FILES_TO_COMBINE with your folder

Will add a user prompt using tkinter if desired for ease of access.

Use case examples:
LinkedIn Recruiter lets you export 25 candidates at a time. I had upwards of 15 excel files I needed consolidated and manual copy paste was frustrating. This allows for quick groupings of batches of files.
